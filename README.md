# Python Simple Projects
In this repository, I will implement some python projects based on different sources on the internet. These projects will help you to gain some hands-on experience in python.

## Tic-Tac-Toe with Min Max Algorithm
In this project, we will implement the Tic-Tac-Toe game. This game uses artificial intelligence to play. The algorithm that uses is the Min-Max algorithm.

## Rock Paper Scissors Multiplayer Game
In this project, we will implement a rock-paper-scissors game. This game is multiplayer, so you can use this game on your network to play with other players. You have to run the `server` first; then, you can join the game by running the `client`.

## DDoS Script
In this project, we implement a simple python script for attacking an IP address with a specific number of processes. This script is not optimal and efficient but can be used for educational purposes.

## Port Scanner
We implement a port scanner script to scan the open ports in a given range of a specific IP address in this project. We do this process with multithreading to make it more efficient. Port scanning is illegal, and this script is for educational purposes.

## TCP Chatroom
In this project, we implemented a simple TCP chatroom. A client can select a nickname in this chatroom, connect to the server, and chat with other clients connected to the server.
